# üß© P4ReviewApp

> IMPORTANT: This repository is an educational, workspace-specific reference. It is not intended as a turnkey project for reproduction on other machines or environments. The code, configuration, and workflow documented here reflect a local Perforce-centric setup and certain environment-specific assumptions that may not work or be appropriate outside the original development workspace. Treat examples and scripts as illustrative rather than production-ready; reproduce at your own discretion and adapt configurations before using in a different environment.

**P4ReviewApp** is a project inspired by **Helix Swarm**, designed to manage and review *Change Lists* from Perforce (**P4**) through a modern web interface and a .NET-based REST API.

## üìÅ Project Structure

This repository currently contains the initial setup of two main projects ‚Äî representing the starting point of the system architecture.

| Project | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **P4ReviewApp.Api** | ASP.NET Core Web API | Provides REST endpoints to communicate with the Perforce server and the frontend application. |
| **P4ReviewApp.Web** | React + TypeScript | Web frontend that will allow users to view, create, and manage *Change List* review requests. |

## üåø Branch Information

- **`main`** ‚Üí Stable branch containing the latest verified version of both backend and frontend.
  This branch mirrors synchronized changes from the **local Perforce (P4)** workspace after validation.
  It represents the **production-ready state** of the project, updated via the synchronization workflow.

## üîÑ Workflow: Perforce to GitHub Synchronization

### üß± Development Workflow

#### **Phase 1: Local Development in Perforce**
- All development activities occur within a **local Perforce (P4) workspace**.
- Developers work on files, make changes, and validate functionality locally.
- Once changes are completed and tested, they are **submitted to Perforce**.

#### **Phase 2: Automated Synchronization Process**
Upon successful submission in Perforce, a server-side trigger runs the **`P4ReviewAppGit.bat`** script, which handles synchronization to GitHub through the following automated steps:

### ‚öôÔ∏è Synchronization Script Execution

#### **1. Environment Configuration**
- Validates the provided changelist number and retrieves its complete description.

#### **2. Change Detection & Validation**
- Verifies the existence of modified files within the Git environment.

#### **3. Commit Preparation**
- Generates a commit message following the standardized convention:
  ```
  P4 CL <number>: <first line of changelist description>
  <remaining changelist description>
  ```
- Maintains complete traceability between **P4 changelists** and **GitHub commits**.

#### **4. Repository Update**
- Executes the commit with the prepared message.
- Pushes the changes to the **GitHub repository (`main` branch)**.

### üöÄ Workflow Characteristics

#### ‚úÖ **Benefits**
- **Optimized Repository Management:** Maintains a clean, well-structured history in GitHub.
- **Automated Traceability:** Each GitHub commit directly references its corresponding P4 changelist.
- **Streamlined Process:** Reduces manual synchronization efforts and potential human error.
- **Consistent Documentation:** Standardized commit messages improve readability and tracking.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Considerations**
- **Non-Parallel Committing:** A single P4 submit may bundle multiple changes into one GitHub commit.
- **Change Management:** Developers should maintain focused file modifications to prevent unintended syncs.
- **Selective Synchronization:** Only files actively worked on should be modified to avoid unnecessary updates.

### üîß Future Enhancements
We are actively exploring solutions to implement **parallel commit capabilities** between P4 and GitHub, allowing for more granular synchronization and enhanced change tracking.

### üß≠ Best Practices
- Keep changelist descriptions **clear and comprehensive**.
- Maintain **focused work** within specific file sets.
- Validate all changes locally before submitting to Perforce. 
- Monitor synchronization results to ensure expected outcomes.

This workflow ensures **robust synchronization** between Perforce and GitHub.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core 8 Web API
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript
- **Version Control:** Perforce (P4) for local development + GitHub for remote sync
- **Internationalization:** i18next integration with automatic language detection
- **AI:** AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Deepseek) to complement development, accelerate deployment, and improve efficiency.
